# 🚗 Remote Car with Camera via WiFi
## 🎯 What I learned from this project

Through the process of completing this project, I have learned and practiced many important practical skills, including:

- 🧠 **Embedded system programming**: Working with ESP32 and Arduino to control motors, process data from sensors.
- 🌐 **Setting up network communication**: The project uses WebSocket to transmit control commands from the web interface to Arduino in a fast and smooth manner. At the same time, the ESP32-CAM camera streams live video to the same interface via WiFi. All functions are displayed on a single web page, which can be easily accessed and controlled from both computers and mobile devices.
- 🎨 **Web interface design**: Creating a user-friendly control page for the car using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 📡 **Signal processing and sensors**: Reading data from distance sensors, encoders, and INA219 current sensors to analyze the car’s performance.
- 🔄 **Hardware and software integration**: Integrating various components into a complete system.
- 🧩 **Real-world problem-solving**: Debugging, testing, optimizing the program, and handling issues during real-world deployment.
- 👥 **Teamwork skills**: Participating as a Team Leader and working with teammates to develop the project. The project achieved the highest score in the class and can be further developed with new features in the future.

> This project not only helped me understand how IoT devices work but also trained my ability to connect hardware and software to create a complete, practical product.
